This is my first repository and this repository contains HTML and CSS files..


Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
I'm Nithin! this is my first ever repository to get into git and github.. Feel free to analize my code and teach me what is wrong..

Files i have added:
1. index.html
2. about.html
3. services.html
4. contacts.html
5. style.css
6. stranger things animated image
7. trees image

Discription of files..
1. index.html:
              This html codes contain a header section inside body of the file which has navigation options to other pages..
              And this is my first codes i had made a many errors or wrong id's.. Feel free to teach me...
              I have used stranger things story for the paragraphs for all the files.. So, it is a spoiler..

2. contacts.html:
                 I have used some of the javascript codes to add information gathered in forms and store it in google sheets..
                 Ofcourse it is copied from a repository..
3. style.css:
             I had made a mistake using dispaly and float values for same elements !! In frank i don't know what to do with those
             two values. I will keep learning this one..
             I didn't use flexbox commands to this files because i have to learn it..
             I simply animated some elements after watching some videos..
